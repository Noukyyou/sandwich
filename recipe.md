INGREDIENTS
 
100 g brussel sprouts
150 g Oyster mushrooms
4 tbsp gravy
2 tbsp tamari
1 tbsp oil
3 tbsp vegan mayo
3 tbsp cranberry sauce
100 g sauerkraut
100 g stuffing
4 slices bread
30 g plant-based butter
INSTRUCTIONS
 
Wash and quarter the brussel sprout and put in a sauce pan with salted water and boil for 10 mins.
Heat a non-stick frying pan on high heat and rip the mushrooms into thin strips. Once the pan is hot add 1/2 tbsp of oil and cook the mushrooms for 5 mins. Using a clean smaller pan, compress the mushrooms to encourage more evaporation and browning – this will result in more flavour. Turn the mushrooms until they are brown on both sides, add in the gravy and tamari and ensure each mushroom is popping with flavour. Remove the mushrooms. Drain and rinse the brussel sprouts and put the frying pan back on high heat. Add ½ tbsp of oil, once hot and add the brussel sprouts and fry until they start to brown on both sides, to add more flavour. Remove and set aside.
Layout the 4 slices of bread, spread mayo on 2 sides and cranberry sauce on the other sides. Divide the brussel sprouts between the 2 sandwiches ensuring there is a thin layer. Layer on the stuffing, followed by the mushrooms, and top with the sauerkraut.
Put the top on the sandwich and butter the outside layer of the top of the sandwich with a thin layer of plant based butter. Heat the frying pan on medium heat and put the butter side down on the pan and fry for 2-3 mins until golden. Butter the top side of the sandwich and turn and repeat until both sides are perfectly golden!Slice and enjoy!
